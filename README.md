## GOAL

This repository will be used to expose use cases of interfaces vs types in typescript


As a decision of the frontender guild, the use of interfaces will be prioritized over types, except for those cases in which the interface is not enough to meet our needs.


One of the objectives is precisely this, to see those cases in which type is completely necessary.

## Resources

Some cool resources explaining differences are:

## Examples
The project provides some examples which can be run with "npm run {exampleNumber}"

### Example 1
Basic typing of and object with type and interfaces. In both cases compiles and autocompletes user props whith no problem.
